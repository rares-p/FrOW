    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      FrOW (Fruits On The Web) is a game intended for primary school students, with the role of improving their memory.

    </p>
    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <p>
      On the main page there are present 4 buttons:
      <ul>
        <li>Start</li>
        <li>Learn</li>
        <li>Highscores</li>
        <li>About</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting the Start button will direct the user to a page where the game settings of the game can be adjusted.
      According to the settings, there will be approximated a difficulty level.
      After Start is selected again, the game begins.
      On the top of the card grid, the user can see the timer (how much time is left for the game), the score and the difficulty (more peppers means higher difficulty).<br>
      The game idea is simple: On the screen you have an even number of hidden cards, where each one has an identical pair.
      The goal is to match every card with an identical one. Each time you click on a card, it is revealed. 
      Then, you have to click on another card to match with. After the second one is also revealed, if they are identical, the cards will dissapear and the score will increase. 
      If not, both cards turn back and you will lose some points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting the Learn button will direct the user to a page where educational information is displayed, regarding different fruits and vegetables.
      The current fruit/vegetable is displayed in the center of the page. The user can change it using the arrow buttons on the left and right, or by searching in the dynamic search bar the name of the plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting the Highscores button will direct the user to a page where the top players are displayed, along with their score, from the highest to the lowest.
      The players are structured in pages, every page containing a maximum of 5 players. To navigate between pages, the user can select the index of it, or click on the arrows to go page by page.
