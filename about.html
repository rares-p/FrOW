                <h3>How To Play</h3>
                <p>The game idea is simple: On the screen you have an even number of hidden cards, where each one has an identical pair.
                    The goal is to match every card with an identical one. Each time you click on a card, it is revealed. 
                    Then, you have to click on another card to match with. After the second one is also revealed, if they are identical, the cards will disappear and the score will increase.
                    If not, both cards turn back. The faster you match every card the more points you get. Bonus points are also awarded if you make less wrong matches</p>
