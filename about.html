                <h3>How To Play</h3>
                <p>The game idea is simple: On the screen you have an even number of hidden cards, where each one has an identical pair.
                    The goal is to match every card with an identical one. Each time you click on a card, it is revealed. 
                    Then, you have to click on another card to match with. After the second one is also revealed, if they are identical, the cards will dissapear and the score will increase. 
                    If not, both cards turn back and you will lose some points.</p>
